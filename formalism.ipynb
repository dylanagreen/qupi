    "First, let's make a \"qubit\". This isn't a rigorous definition of a qubit, instead, we only define it with everything we need for this experiment. To this end, I have encoded the qubit's rotation around the y-axis as an intrinsic property of the qubit. This means that the qubit is being rotated around the $y$-axis on a time scale, which gives the qubit an internal \"probability\" of being measured in the $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ state, depending on what time (after the rotation begins) you measure the qubit."
